Hello, my name is Branden Lowe and I have been learning Python. 
I've recently been into programing, and I'm intrested in becoming a software developer. 
My goal is to learn as much as I can independently, so I can follow my passions.
I have a Bachelors in Game Development/ Game Design, and it's been fun learning on how to make games.
I want to create games as a carrer, and this would be my first option to pick between becoming a software dev or Game dev.

I got intreseted in technology since highschool because I'd play video games, and I'd love going to arcades.
Once I got my first I phone, and saw all the social media apps, I wanted to one day be apart of creating an app for the I phone.
I have a sports background in baseball, and that's what kept me focused on school. I've also learned many things like how to be 
a team player.

When it comes to working, I've had 3 jobs, and I'm currently working 2 jobs. 
I work as Supervisor at Jersey Mikes, and I also work as an Instructor for an after school program. That company is called Parker Anderson Enrichment (PAE)
I'm currently trying to look for a tech job, or a job in the game industry. 

I hope to achive many mini goals I have planned forthe future, and I'm excited to be on the programming path because it can open up doors for me.
